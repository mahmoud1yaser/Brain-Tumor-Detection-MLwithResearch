## Information
- The project Back-end is made using Deep learning (Python). <br>
> General Information
- This project is Mathematical Modelling of Detection of Brain Tumor which was required by our college to further join a comptetion where our team pirates got the 2nd place in it.
  - The content of this project will include:
    - Poster which illustrate our full project
    - Implementing our algorithm using Deep Learning to detect brain tumor in jupyter notebook (Accuracy 97%)
    - Report which descirbe the full research process
    - Presentation to present our full idea
